To run the example in docker, do the following

Download the docker install file for your system

For the pre-built docker image, run (future build)

   docker run -p 4000:80 -it --entrypoint /bin/bash essentialsofparallelcomputing/chapter13

Alternatively, build an image locally and run it 

   docker build -t chapter13 .

   docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash chapter13

To run the docker image with a graphical user interface (GUI) on Mac OSx

install XQuartz -- brew cask install xQuartz

start up xQuartz (may have to start up an app with a right click) and then in the menu bar at the top of the screen, 
select XQuartz->Preferences. Go to Security tab and add allow connections from network clients

reboot Mac system

Start up xQuartz

Start up docker image with

docker run -it -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --entrypoint /bin/bash chapter13

Change to chapter13 user

su chapter13

Now run the GUI with

nvvp 

Other applications such as CodeXL may still have difficulties

Getting access to the Nvidia GPUs is done with the --gpus option to Docker. This feature was added with 
the 19.0.3 version of Docker. For Intel GPUs, try --device=/dev/dri. For AMD GPUs, try

docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined

For Intel Advisor, Inspector or VTune, add --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE to the docker run command.
